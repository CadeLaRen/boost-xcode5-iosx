This repo is practially a fork of https://github.com/wuhao5/boost.
Only this one does not contain boost source code, thus is more lightweight.

The script mentioned above in it's turn is based on great work by Pete Goodliffe

* http://goodliffe.blogspot.com.au/2009/12/boost-on-iphone.html

And lots of contributions by other people.
